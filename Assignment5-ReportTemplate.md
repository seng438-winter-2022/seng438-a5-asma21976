# Introduction

# 
The purpose of this assignment is to give us hands-on experience on assessing the reliability of a hypothetical system given all the failure data gathered from the integration testing. We are required to install a reliability growth assessment tool, such as CASRE or STRAT, and create plots of failure rate and reliability of SUT. 
After completing this lab, we gained an understanding of what reliability growth testing is. We are also able to measure failure rate, MTTF and reliability of the SUT through analyzing the test data. Lastly, we became familiar with the features and usages of a reliability growth testing too.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
Our team used C-FRAT for this section, as STRAT does not work for mac users. The failure data was imported first. The imported data includes, IFRSB, IFRGSB, S, GM, DW2, DW3, NB2, and TL. The software generated a Total Cumulative Failure vs Time interval graph:
